                Hi! My name is Gloria and I am a software engineer based out of
                New York. I am deeply passionate about promoting equity and
                diversity in tech. Currently, I work at{" "}
                <span className="bold">
                  Goldman Sachs as a frontend developer
                </span>
                . As a curious learner, I am always striving to learn the
                intricacies involved in web dev, from bundle configurations to
                building components.
              </p>
              <p>
                I studied

                  Linguistics and Computer Science at UCLA
                </span>
                . In studying the two fields together, I have learned how the
                seemingly independent concepts of language can be explored at a
                deeper level to relate to the logical foundation of computer
                science (fun fact: the two are WAY more intertwined than just
                NLP!).

                Outside of work, I am a volunteer programmer for the Endangered
                Language Alliance. We are working on digitizing archives to
                preserve less spoken languages and make them more accessible to
                all. Additionally, I am an avid climber, occasional boxer and
                amateur seamstress.
